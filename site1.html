        <p>Dr. Mary Walker was not afraid to speak her mind to politicians, 
            including in an audience with Abraham Lincoln. Perhaps that is why she was 
            often filmed candidly in the area of City Hall. She was considered an oddity 
            when she walked the streets in pants, coat and top hat, and people would take 
            surreptitious photos of her. Even though Walker was a Medal of Honor recipient 
            and Civil War veteran, people often insulted her. Some written accounts say people 
            even threw tomatoes at her as she walked through town. She was once arrested (not in Oswego) 
            for “impersonating a man.” When asked why she wore men’s clothes, she responded: “I don’t 
            wear men’s clothes; I wear my own clothes.”</p>
