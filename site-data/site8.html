                <p>Fort Ontario was significant in the Civil War as a recruitment center for
                    soldiers and Oswego County sent a disproportionately high number of recruits
                    to the Union army. Dr. Mary Walker was only associated with the Fort in her
                    later years. The 1906 photograph of Dr. Walker standing under an umbrella
                    was taken on the road in front of Officers Row, a line of brick buildings no
                    longer there, which was near the current road between the main and overlook
                    parking lots. The occasion was the July 4th Independence Day Parade which
                    also celebrated the reopening of Fort Ontario after a huge construction and
                    modernization project. In the background is the main ballfield and houses
                    along East 9th Street. She was later treated at the Fort Ontario Army
                    Hospital #5 in the summer of 1918 after she suffered from a "stroke of
                    paralysis". The Fort Ontario newspaper, the Ontario Chronicles, reported
                    her death in February 1919, saying, "The career of the woman physician,
                    one of the first in the history of the country, was picturesque and brimful.
                    She was the first woman to hold a commission as assistant army surgeon,
                    having served in that capacity in the Civil War. Dr. Walker considered it the greatest personal compliment to be mistaken for a man. Her death will be gravely felt within the ranks of feminism, a cause which she did much to further through her long life."</p>
