        <p>A historic roadside marker on Bunker HIll Road is all that is left at the location of the 
            family farm and birthplace of Dr. Mary Walker. She was born here on November 26, 1832. Her 
            parents were abolitionists Alvah and Vesta Whitcomb Walker. She had four sisters: Aurora, 
            Luna, Vesta, Cynthia, and one brother, Alvah Jr. As a child, her father encouraged his 
            daughters to forgo corsets and wear pants under a short skirt for health reasons. She 
            continued through her life to dress this way, and advocated for dress reform. In her later 
            years, she dressed exclusively in pants and a jacket. Alvah started the first one room 
            schoolhouse in the Town of Oswego and education was encouraged for the girls, which was unusual 
            for the time. Alvah was interested in all kinds of subjects, including medicine, and allowed 
            Mary to read the medical books in his library which inspired her interest in medicine. 
            This was the only permanent home she had during her lifetime; she eventually inherited it and 
            lived here until her death in 1919. The homestead burned in the 1930â€™s.
