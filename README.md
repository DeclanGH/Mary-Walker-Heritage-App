# Mary Walker Heritage App

Background
==========

The Oswego County Historical Society was founded in 1896 and has preserved and promoted the history of the greater Oswego community for over a century. It owns and operates the Richardson-Bates Historic House Museum in the city of Oswego which also serves as a repository for thousands of artifacts, photographs and manuscript collections that document the county's history and interprets the history of the people, places and events of Oswego County through exhibits and educational programs. They work towards preserving the history of notable people coming from here such as Dr. Mary Walker, the only female recipient of the Medal of Honor, and after whom the health center on campus was named.

Objective
=========

The objective of this project is to design and implement a software application taking tourists on a self-guided driving tour of Dr Mary Walker sites in Oswego and the Town of Oswego. The tour comprises 9 stops, each of which present prudent information about the site and Mary Walker. As a special gimmick, the application shall be sensitive to the tourist's location such that information becomes available as soon as they are in front of a site. Information may be photographs, audio tracks, videos, and/or written text.Â 

Key Features & Challenges
=========================

The system features should have the following:

-   Meet and discuss historical information with the stakeholder

-   Collect, prepare, and suitably store site information

-   Devise a mechanism to interact with the user when at the historic site

-   Afford to track user progress either through interactions or through, e.g., GPS

-   Allow posting reactions, etc. to social media to promote the tour

Stakeholders, Resources, and Further Information
================================================

This project is in cooperation with Mary Kay Stone (<imgamemk@aol.com>), President of the Oswego Country Historical Society and Professor Dr. James Early (<james.early@oswego.edu>). We will need to meet with them to elicit requirements, come up with useful features, and coordinate implementation.
